The feature compiler accepts as source code specifications written in a language called Gherkin and compiles it with respect to a given feature class. 

Gherkin is plain-text English (or one of 60+ other languages) with a little extra structure. Gherkin is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains.

In Gherkin, each line that isn't blank has start with a Gherkin keyword, followed by any text you like. The main keywords are:
     - Feature
     - Scenario
     - Given, When, Then, And (Steps)
     - Background
     - Scenario Outline
     - Examples
